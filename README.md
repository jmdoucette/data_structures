# Data Structures
made by James Doucette

This is a personal project I worked on implementing several important data structures in python. My goals in doing this were to get practice with object oriented programming, unit testing and publishing python packages on pip.

Many  of these are already implemented by default in python or are in a library which is commonly used. However, some of them either do not exist or have a library implementation that lacks some key features. The commonly used heap package heapq does not support changing priorities in logarithmic time, and I could not find a good library implementing union find.
